## Stock Market Analysis Using Python

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis and prediction of stock prices using machine learning techniques. The application leverages real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance and presents it in a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

**Steps:**

1. Download Python and Anaconda Navigator.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open Jupyter notebook and run the stock.ipynb file. In the last step, it will automatically create a .keras file in the desired location.
4. Install the required packages.
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - tensorflow
   - keras
   - yfinance
   - streamlit
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn
   - ta (Technical Analysis Library in Python)

5. Run the Streamlit application: ```streamlit run stock.py```

**Usage**
1. Enter Stock Symbol: Input the stock symbol you want to analyze (e.g., GOOG for Google).
2. Select Date Range: Choose the start and end date for the stock data.
3. View Data: Explore the fetched stock data and calculated technical indicators.
4. Visualize Trends: View various plots comparing stock prices with different moving averages.
5. Predict Prices: See the predicted stock prices and compare them with the actual prices.
